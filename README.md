## Saltzman & Myers (2018) Replication

### Background
A colleague of ours, whom with we shared the data from the published manuscript, identified an issue in our stimulus presentation during the phonetic categorization phase. While we believed that there were 8 repetitions of each of the 7 stimulus steps, a programming error lead to uneven distributions of each continuum step. Therefore, it is possible the effects we saw were due to selective adaptation and not lexically-guided perceptual learning.

The published data and analysis code are availalble in this repository under "Published Data".

### The Replication
We performed a corrected replication (with the intended stimulus distributions in the phonetic categorization phase) of the original experiment using the online platform Prolific. Experimental presentation was handled through Gorilla, which included two headphone checks to ensure that participants used roughly similar equipment to that which was used in the lab. 120 participants were recruited.

We allowed participants to begin session 2 at a minimum of 7 days (the average time between session 1 and 2 in SM2018) after their first session completed. As in SM2018, we only included participants who completed both sessions, and used the same accuracy criteria (minimum 80% accuracy at each endpoint during the phonetic categorization tasks) to exclude participants. In addition, we excluded any participant who failed both headphone checks. The resulting sample includes 62 participants.
