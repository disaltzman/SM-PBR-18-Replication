## Saltzman & Myers (2018) Replication

### Background
A colleague of ours, who with we shared the data from the published manuscript, identified an issue in our stimulus presentation during the phonetic categorization phase. While we believed that there were 8 repetitions of each of the 7 stimulus steps, a programming error lead to uneven distributions of each continuum step. Therefore, it is possible the effects we saw were due to selective adaptation and not lexically-guided perceptual learning.

The published data and analysis code are availalble in this repository under "Published Data".

### The Replication
We performed a replication of the original experiment, with the corrected stimulus distributions in the phonetic categorization phase, using the online platform Prolific. Experimental presentation was handled through Gorilla, which included several headphone checks to try and adhere to the original protocol. Given limitations of the Gorilla platform, we fixed the interval between session 1 and session 2. A total of N participants were recruited, of whom N met the inclusionary criteria set in the published manuscript.
